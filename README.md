# Population-project

The overall aims of this notebook are as follows:

* Manipulate the population data to show the age profile of the whole population of England.
* Visualize the distribution of the younger, older, and median ages for each Lower Super Output Area (LSOA). We want to ascertain the distributions of the age ranges across the different LSOAs.
* Compare the median age distributions by Lower Super Output Area type to see the age profile that lives in the different types of areas.
* We want to see if there are any unusual areas based on their porportion

Examine the relationship between the younger and older proportions across the LSOAs.
1. Bar Chart for Age Profile
2. Distribution of the Younger, Older, and Median Ages in Each LSOA
3. Comparing the Median Age Distributions by Area Type
4. Classification of Unusual Areas by Proportions
